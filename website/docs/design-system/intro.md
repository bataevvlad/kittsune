# Eva Design System

Kittsune is a React Native implementation of [Eva Design System](https://eva.design). This means that components visual style and behavior are based on Design System rules and agreements.

---

## Principles

Eva is a customizable Design System based on Atomic Design Principles. All components are built based on basic elements with shared styles, connected with a single Visual Language for both Mobile and Web platforms. Most importantly, Eva is built to be customizable, meaning architectural support of multiple themes across all components and supporting platforms.

---

## Implementations

Eva Design System is implemented for two platforms:

- Mobile - Kittsune
- Web - [Nebular](https://github.com/akveo/nebular)

Both implementations have a single source of truth for styles and unified theming system.

---

## Supported themes

Currently, there are 2 built-in themes provided by Eva Design System:

- `light` - clean white theme
- `dark` - dark theme

Theme extension mechanism allows modifying one theme with another.

## Enterprise ready

Being a part of Eva Ecosystem, Kittsune is a great choice for Enterprise-grade products, providing complete control over application look & feel.
