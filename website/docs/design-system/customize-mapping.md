# Customize Component Mapping

Kittsune components are styled with Eva Design System configuration files and themes. When we talk about configuration files we mean a mapping provided by Eva Design System. This configuration file is later processed by Eva Design System Processor to provide a final style applied by a component.

In terms of Kittsune the mapping configuration file is a JSON or a JavaScript object which describes the rules and behavior for each component provided by Kittsune.

Working with mappings is a quite difficult process, but it gives you a lot of flexibility to style components. Let's take a look at some simple examples of customizing Kittsune components.

## Determine a change

You're able to do the following changes in mapping:

- Change a single [parameter](/docs/design-system/glossary#parameter)
- Change a [semantic property](/docs/design-system/glossary#semantic-properties)

While changing a single parameter is a simple process, changing semantic properties is a bit harder. However, read a corresponding guide below to see how it could be done.

## Create a mapping

Let's create a file to define a mapping. In your project root, create a `mapping.json`:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "Button": {
      "meta": {},
      "appearances": {}
    }
  }
}
```

The code above contains a bare minimum of code to start customizing a Button component.

## Change a single parameter

Let's assume we want to change the default `backgroundColor` of a Button. Before we do this, let's take a look at how it is configured by Eva Design System. Open a configuration file. It should be located in `./PROJECT_ROOT/node_modules/@kittsune/eva/mapping.json`.

In order to change the **default** parameter, you need to find out where it is declared. To do that, we can quickly look through a meta-information about a component.

```json
{
  "components": {
    "Button": {
      "meta": {
        "appearances": {
          "filled": {
            "default": true
          }
        },
        "variantGroups": {
          "status": {
            "primary": {
              "default": true
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We determined that default appearance is `filled` and default variant for a `status` group is `primary`. This means, that a `backgroundColor` property should be declared inside some of them. Let's now find a default appearance configuration.

```json
{
  "components": {
    "Button": {
      "meta": {},
      "appearances": {
        "filled": {
          "mapping": {},
          "variantGroups": {
            "status": {
              "primary": {
                "backgroundColor": "color-primary-default"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now let's go back to our `mapping.json` and modify `backgroundColor` to be `pink`:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "Button": {
      "meta": {},
      "appearances": {
        "filled": {
          "mapping": {},
          "variantGroups": {
            "status": {
              "primary": {
                "backgroundColor": "pink"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Merge mappings

The only thing we have to do is to pass our mapping to an `ApplicationProvider` component.

```js
import React from 'react';
import * as eva from '@kittsune/eva';
import { ApplicationProvider } from '@kittsune/components';
import { default as mapping } from './path-to/mapping.json'; // <-- import mapping

export default () => (
  <ApplicationProvider
    {...eva}
    customMapping={mapping}
    theme={eva.light}>
  </ApplicationProvider>
);
```

:::info
Custom Mapping is applied automatically in case of using `@kittsune/metro-config` package, meaning there is no need to modify ApplicationProvider. To check this, see if it used in metro.config.js. [Relative guide](/docs/guides/improving-performance).
:::

Here we are. Now the default `backgroundColor` of a Button should be `pink`. Here is a result:

## Change a semantic parameter

Making changes with semantic parameters means changing a set of parameters declared inside it. To do that, simply follow the steps of changing a single parameter explained above.

You are also able to make one of the semantic parameters to be used by default. Let's take an example with a Button appearance.

```json
{
  "components": {
    "Button": {
      "meta": {
        "appearances": {
          "outline": {
            "default": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. Now you're able to use Kittsune Button without passing `appearance` property.
