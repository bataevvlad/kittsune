# Where to start?

Kittsune is a framework of UI components powered by Eva Design System for your next [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) application. Despite it is not required to know React Native framework to set up your first Kittsune project, it is highly recommended to go through the React Native tutorial beforehand and be familiar with basic React Native concepts.

## Quick start tutorials

- [Start a new App](/docs/guides/getting-started#new-apps) with a single command from a terminal.
- [Install into existing App](/docs/guides/getting-started#manual-installation). Already run some code? No problem.

Please consider creating an issue on GitHub if your use case is not described above. But we kindly ask to always look through the documentation and the list of existing issues first.

## I'm new to React Native or mobile development

Quite often we receive messages from people who ask us for the advice we can give them if they are completely new to software engineering and/or React Native in particular. Well, we can't say that there's some general way, unfortunately. Each advice should be aimed at a particular person, his current skills set and goals. That's why we believe that each person knows better for himself. But in any case, there are multiple resources like https://www.coursera.org/ or https://egghead.io/ which focus on providing online education.
