# Running on the Web

Kittsune has built-in support for web sites using [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web).

:::warning IMPORTANT
This has not yet been widely used in production and we consider this feature to be experimental. However, you can follow instructions below to configure your app running in browser.
:::

## Quick Start

In case you're going to start a new project with web support, the best way to do this is to use Expo. Follow the [Installation Guide](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/get-started/installation/) and then get back to the [Manual Installation](/docs/guides/getting-started#manual-installation) of Kittsune.

---

## Existing Expo Applications

Read the great documentation from Expo team to [add web support in existing Expo projects](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/running-in-the-browser).

---

## Regular React Native Applications

In case you don't use Expo, and have already initialized React Native Application using `react-native init`, please follow [official React Native Web Guide](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/?path=/docs/guides-multi-platform--page).

## Conclusion

If you already have all in place, Kittsune does not force you creating any additional web-specific configuration. The next step to create a multi-platform app would be [Branding](/docs/guides/branding) and launching it on both mobile device and browser.
